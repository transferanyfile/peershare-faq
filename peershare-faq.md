# Peershare
Securely transfer any file you want to anyone you want.

## What is this?
A simple web application that allows you to share any file from your device, safely and securely with others across the internet. 

## How does this work?
Peershare uses two real-time communication protocols found in all modern web browsers, [Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket) and [WebRTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC).

The first provides and quick and easy way for a web browser (in this case someone who wishes to share a file) to know, via a web server, which recipients (people you’ve shared a URL with) would like to receive your file.

The second provides a secure peer-to-peer connection between individual devices (through a web browser). This provides the ability to send encrypted information back and forth to each other without the need for a central server in the middle holding the information itself. 

## Does Peershare make a profit?
It doesn’t actually. Peershare is 100% free and is nothing more than a labor of love to build something simple and useful while not trying to infringe on the privacy of it’s users in order to survive. It is intentially created to not scale in order not to demand more from those who use it. 

In light of that if you find value in this product, please consider supporting it with a donation of whatever you feel like to help the up keep of the server cost. It is by no means necessary however.

## With Dropbox and Google Drive existing what’s the point of this?
Peershare was created with a strong philosophy to uphold ethical practices and the privacy of it’s users. While companies like Dropbox or Google most likely do the same, at the end of the day a business exists to make money and may some times operate in grey areas (such as exploiting user behavior and their data) in order to turn a profit.

Peershare avoids this completely by first, aiming to never be a profitable business (not everything needs to scale) and secondly, it is simply the vehicle to transfer data, it has no way of storing or hosting file data for any long or short term.
